# Dotfiles

A place for me to store my various dotfiles. It is initally being used to version control my .vimrc file.

### Installation

I have attempted to make this as portable as possible by using an install script.

Steps:

- Clone this to your home directory
- CD into ~/dotfiles/
- If you don't have Vundle installed, run ```chmod +x install-vundle.sh; ./install-vundle;```
- Then run ```chmod +x makesymlinks.sh; ./makesymlinks.sh```
- That's it!

Enjoy! ‚úåüèº
