# Dotfiles

A place for me to store my various dotfiles. It is initally being used to version control my .vimrc file.

### Installation

I have attempted to make this as portable as possible by using an install script.

To move from machine to machine, simply clone this to your home directory, cd into it, and then run 

```
chmod +x makesymlinks.sh; ./makesymlinks.sh
```

Enjoy! ‚úåüèº
